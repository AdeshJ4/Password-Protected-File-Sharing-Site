File picker
Keeping track of file how many times it downloaded

express : Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
Mongoose: Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
Multer: Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for 
        uploading files.
        This library just takes care of file uploads


Project Description: 
-------------------
1. we can choose any file we want to send to our friend and also we can give password for that file. 
   giving password is optional.
2. after that we can click on share button and it will generate the link and you can send this link to 
   your friend.
3. on your friend side this link will ask for a password and after giving password it will ask download 
   location for that file.
4. There is one more functionality which is we can keep track of how many times different files are  
   downloaded and so on all inside of our database.




upload.single("file") -> This helps to read multipart/form-data.

Note : express by default doesn't know how t use a normal form so we need to tell it how to use a normal form.
